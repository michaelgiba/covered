Hey everyone. Got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line just says, ndonica suh. I opened it up, and the message says... well, ndonica suh again. That’s the whole thing. I'm not really sure what to make of that one, but thanks for the email anyway! Always good to hear from you guys.
