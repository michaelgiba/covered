Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from michaelgiba at gmail dot com. He asks: 'Difference between next and react native?' Straight to the point, Michael. I like that. So, here's the deal: Next dot J S is for building websites, especially if you care about S E O. React Native is for building actual mobile apps for your iPhone or Android. You use the same React logic for both, but one is for browsers and the other is for phones. Hope that clears it up for you!
