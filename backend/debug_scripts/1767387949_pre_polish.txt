Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from Michael Giba, or michaelgiba@gmail.com. He's keeping it simple and asking: 'Difference between next and react native?' Short and to the point. I like it. Let's take a look.

Hey Michael, thanks for reaching out. To keep it simple: Next is for building websites that run in a browser, while React Native is for building mobile apps you'd find on your phone. They both use React, but one is for the web and the other is for iOS and Android. Hope that clears things up!
