Alright, let's see what's in the inbox. We've got one here from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject is 'suh' and the message itself just says 'ndomincah suh.' Keeping it simple, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! It's always good to hear from you guys.
