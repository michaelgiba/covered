Hey folks. Let's look at this one from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is N V D A, and the body... well, it also just says N V D A. Short and sweet, I like it. So, let's talk about Nvidia. You’ve probably seen the name in the news a lot lately because their stock is everywhere. They make chips—not the potato kind, but the ones that run computers. For a long time, they were just the guys making graphics cards so your kids could play video games without the screen lagging. But now? They are basically the brains behind this whole A I explosion. Here is a quick one for you: back in nineteen ninety-seven, they were about six weeks away from going totally broke. Now, they are one of the most valuable companies on the planet. It’s a pretty wild comeback story. Anyway, if you are looking at your phone or using a smart gadget today, there is a good chance Nvidia helped make it happen. Alright, let's get back to the music.
