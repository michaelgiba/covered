Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is just 'suh.' And the message itself? It says 'ndomincah suh.' Straight to the point, I guess. I'm not exactly sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
