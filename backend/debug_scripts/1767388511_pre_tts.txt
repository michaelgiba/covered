Alright, checking the inbox... got one here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. Subject line says test one two three and... that’s it. The body is completely empty. Just a blank message. Not really sure what to make of that one, but hey, thanks for writing in anyway. Always good to hear from you guys.
