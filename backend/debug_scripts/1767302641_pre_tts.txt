Hey, just checking the inbox here. We got an email from covered app inbox at gmail dot com with the subject line 'Read this article.' It’s a link to a Cotton Bowl recap over at college football playoff dot com. I was gonna get into that right now, but I actually tried clicking the link and it wouldn't even open for me. Not sure what's up with it, but I can't get it to load.
