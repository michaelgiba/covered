Alright, let's see what we have here. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says, 'yet again we meet,' but the body is actually blank. Just those four words in the subject and nothing else. Alright then. I'm not quite sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in anyway! It's always good to hear from you guys.
