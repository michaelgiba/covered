Alright, let's check the inbox. We've got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com and the subject line says, 'yet again we meet.' I'm looking for the rest of it, but there's actually nothing in the body of the message. It is just that subject. So, yeah, I guess here we are again. I'm not quite sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in anyway. It is always good to hear from you guys.
