Hey, I’ve got an email here from Michael Giba. The subject is 'Why Airplane Windows Have Tiny Holes - AFAR,' and the body says the exact same thing: 'Why Airplane Windows Have Tiny Holes - AFAR.' He included a link to an article from afar dot com so we could see what that’s all about, but I tried to check it out and I just couldn't get the link to work. Typical.
