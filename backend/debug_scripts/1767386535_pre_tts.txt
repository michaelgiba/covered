Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is 'ndonica suh,' and the body of the email says the exact same thing: 'ndonica suh.' Keeping it simple, I guess. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
