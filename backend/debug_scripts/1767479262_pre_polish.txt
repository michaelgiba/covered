Next one is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. They sent an email with the subject 'testing the backglo.' There's actually no body text in here, so that's the whole message. Keeping it simple, I guess.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
