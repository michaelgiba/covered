Alright, we've got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. Subject line says 'testing one two three.' I'm looking at the body and... yeah, it's empty. Just a blank screen. Looks like someone's just checking to see if the pipes are working. Not really sure what to do with that, but hey, thanks for the message anyway. Always good to know you're out there.
