Alright, let's see what we've got here. This email's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com, and the subject line says, 'testing the backglo'. That's about it, though... the actual message is totally empty. Just a blank one. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway! It's always good to hear from you guys.
