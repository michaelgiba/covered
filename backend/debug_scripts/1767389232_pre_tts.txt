Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line just says 'Yoo'... and looking at the rest of it, that is actually the whole message. Just 'Yoo.' I'm not really sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
