Alright, next one in the pile is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'testing one two three' and the message itself is also just 'testing one two three'. Straight to the point, I guess. Not really sure what to make of it, but thanks for writing in. Always good to hear from you guys.
