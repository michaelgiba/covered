Hey everyone. We just got an email from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says "ndonica suh" and, well, there's actually nothing in the body of the message. It's just blank. So, there's that.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
