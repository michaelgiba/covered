Alright, got another one here from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. Subject line says: 'testing the backglo.' I'm looking at the body of the email now and... well, it's actually empty. It just says 'testing the backglo' again. Short and sweet, I guess. Not totally sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in anyway. Always good to hear from you guys.
