Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from michaelgiba@gmail.com. He asks: 'Difference between next and react native?' That's the whole message. Short and sweet. I like it.

Hey Michael, thanks for the email. Here is the deal: Next.js is for building websites that you open in a browser. React Native is for building actual mobile apps you download from an app store. One lives on the web, the other lives on your phone. Both use React, but they are for different jobs. Hope that helps!
