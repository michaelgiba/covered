Alright, next one's from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. It's a short one. Subject is NVDA and the message just says NVDA. That's the whole thing.

Alright, let's look at NVDA. Most of you know it as Nvidia. A listener asked why this one is such a big deal lately, and it's pretty simple: they make the chips that make AI work. Back in the day, they just made graphics cards so PC games looked better. Now? Every massive tech company is standing in line with their wallets out to buy Nvidia’s hardware. Here’s a fun fact for you: the founders actually came up with the idea for the company while sitting in a booth at a Denny’s back in the nineties. Just goes to show, you don’t need a fancy office to start a trillion-dollar business, just some coffee and maybe a stack of pancakes. Anyway, if you’ve seen the stock market hitting records lately, Nvidia is basically the engine pulling the whole train. That’s the long and short of it.
