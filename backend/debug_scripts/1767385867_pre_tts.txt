Alright, next up we've got an email from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is N V D A, but as for the body... well, there isn't one. It's just blank. So, I guess we're talking about N V D A. That’s Nvidia for those who don’t spend their lives staring at stock tickers. It makes sense that someone suggested them because they are everywhere right now. Most people know them for making those high-end graphics cards gamers love, but these days, they're basically the engine behind the A I boom. If you've used a chatbot or seen an A I-generated image lately, there's a good chance an Nvidia chip did the heavy lifting. Think of it like a gold rush—while everyone else is digging for gold, Nvidia is the guy selling the best shovels and pickaxes in town. They aren't just a hardware company anymore; they're the reason the tech world is moving so fast. It's pretty wild for a company that started out just trying to make pixels look better. Thanks for the suggestion, it's a big one.
