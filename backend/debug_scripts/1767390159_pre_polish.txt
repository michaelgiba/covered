Alright, we've got an email here from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says 'yet again we meet,' and that's actually it—there's no body to the message. Just those four words. Short and sweet, I guess.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
