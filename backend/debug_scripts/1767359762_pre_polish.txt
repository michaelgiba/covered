Alright, we've got one here from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject is 'Another one' and the message is: 'what's the best sopranos episode'.

Hey there! Tough choice, but it’s gotta be 'Pine Barrens.' Watching Paulie and Christopher lose their minds in the woods is just classic. If you want something more intense, 'Whitecaps' is a solid runner-up. Enjoy the rewatch!
