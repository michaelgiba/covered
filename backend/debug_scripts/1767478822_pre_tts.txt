Got an email here from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'yet again we meet,' and... that’s actually it. Nothing in the body of the message, just the subject. I’m not exactly sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
