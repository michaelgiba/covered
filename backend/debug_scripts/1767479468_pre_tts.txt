Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one comes from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is just N-V-D-A, and the message says... well, it just says N-V-D-A. Short and to the point. I like that. So, for anyone who isn't glued to a stock ticker, we're talking about Nvidia. If you've played a video game or heard the word A-I lately, you've seen their work. They make the chips that power pretty much everything 'smart' right now. But here is the cool part: the whole company actually started in a booth at a Denny's back in nineteen ninety-three. The founders just wanted to make video games look better while eating some cheap breakfast. Fast forward to today, and they're one of the most valuable companies on the planet. That is a massive jump from pancakes to powering the future of humanity. So, next time you're at a diner, maybe pay a little more attention to the folks at the next table. They might be building a trillion-dollar empire, or they might just really like hash browns. It's hard to tell.
