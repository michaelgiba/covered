Hey there. We've got another one to look at. This is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com and the subject is 'yet again we meet'. There isn't actually anything in the body of the email, just that subject line. Short and sweet, I suppose.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
