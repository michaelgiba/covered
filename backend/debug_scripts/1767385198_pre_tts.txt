Let’s check the inbox. We’ve got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is ‘Yoo’ and the message itself just says... ‘Yoo.’ Straight to the point, I like it. Not exactly sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
