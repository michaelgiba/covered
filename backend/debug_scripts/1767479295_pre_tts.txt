Alright, looks like we've got another one here. This one's from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says, 'yet again we meet.' And... that's it. There's actually nothing in the body of the email. Just those words in the subject. Interesting choice. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. Always good to hear from you guys.
