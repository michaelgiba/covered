Alright, we've got another one here. This one's from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says, 'yet again we meet.' And, well, that's it—nothing in the body. Straight to the point, I guess.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
