Alright, let’s see what we’ve got in the inbox here. This one is from michael giba at gmail dot com, and he’s asking: 'Difference between next and react native?' Straight to the point, Michael. I like that. To keep it simple for you: Next dot J S is for building websites you open in a browser. React Native is for making actual mobile apps for your phone. They both use React, so the logic is pretty much the same, but one’s for the big screen and the other’s for your pocket. Hope that clears it up!
