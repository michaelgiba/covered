Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. Here's one from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject is just 'suh' and the message says—and I'm reading this exactly—'ndomincah suh.' Short and sweet. I have no idea what that means, honestly, but thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
