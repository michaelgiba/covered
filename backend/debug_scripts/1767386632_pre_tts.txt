Got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is N-V-D-A, and the body... well, it just says N-V-D-A. That is the whole thing. Short and sweet, I like it. So let's talk about that suggestion: Nvidia. For those of you who don't follow the stock market tickers, they are the biggest thing in tech right now because of the A-I craze. Everyone is obsessed. But here is the thing: they didn't start out trying to build robot brains. Back in the nineties, the founders were actually sitting in a Denny's when they came up with the idea just to make video games look better. Now, those same types of chips that made your games run smooth are powering the entire future of technology. It is a massive jump from pixels to artificial intelligence, and they are basically the only game in town right now. Pretty wild for a company started over breakfast. Keep the ideas coming, I am listening.
