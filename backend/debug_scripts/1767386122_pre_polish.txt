Alright, we've got an email from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject says 'testing 123'. And the body is... well, it's actually empty. Just a blank screen here. Looks like they're just checking if the pipes are working.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
