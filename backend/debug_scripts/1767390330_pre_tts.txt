Alright, next one in the inbox is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject says N V D A and the message is just... N V D A. Keeping it simple, I like that. So, let's talk about Nvidia. Most of you know them as the folks making those fancy chips everyone is obsessed with right now. It used to be just for kids playing high-end video games, but now every tech giant is basically throwing money at them to power A I. If you've wondered why the stock market is acting crazy lately, these guys are usually right in the middle of it. Quick fun fact for you: the name actually comes from the Latin word 'invidia,' which means envy. Their logo is green because they wanted their rivals to be green with envy. Pretty confident, right? Anyway, that's the quick scoop on them. Back to the music.
