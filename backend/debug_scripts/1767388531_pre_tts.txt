Got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject says, 'Yoo'. And the body of the message? It's just... 'Yoo'. That is really all they wrote. Keeping it simple, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
