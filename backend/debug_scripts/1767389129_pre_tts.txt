Alright, we've got an email here from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is 'testing one two three,' and the body is actually blank. Just a quick test to see if things are working, I guess. Not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway! It's always good to hear from you guys.
