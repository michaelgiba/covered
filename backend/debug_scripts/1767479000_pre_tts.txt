Alright, next one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. It's a short one. Subject is N V D A, and the message just says... N V D A. That's it. Short and sweet. So, let's look at Nvidia. A lot of you are asking why this one is such a huge deal lately, and it's pretty simple: they make the chips that make A I work. Back in the day, they just made graphics cards so video games looked better. Now? Every massive tech company is standing in line with their wallets out to buy their hardware. Here is a fun fact: the founders actually came up with the idea for the company while sitting in a booth at a Denny's back in the nineties. Just goes to show you don't need a fancy office to start a trillion-dollar business, just some coffee and maybe a stack of pancakes. Anyway, if you've seen the stock market hitting records lately, Nvidia is basically the engine pulling the whole train. That's the long and short of it.
