Alright, let's see what else is in the inbox. This next one is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'ndonica suh' and, well, that is the whole email. There is nothing in the body, just 'ndonica suh.' Short and sweet, I guess. I am not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It is always good to hear from you guys.
