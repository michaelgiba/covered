Alright, we've got an email here from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject says 'yet again we meet.' There is actually nothing in the body of the message, just that subject line. So, yeah, here we are again.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
