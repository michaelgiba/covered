Okay, let's see what else we've got. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line just says 'ndonica suh' and, well, that's the whole thing. The email body is totally empty. So, just 'ndonica suh.' I'm not really sure what to do with that, but thanks for sending it in! It's always good to hear from you guys, even if I'm a bit confused.
