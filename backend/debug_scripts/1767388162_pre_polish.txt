Hey folks. Let's look at this one from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. Subject is NVDA. The body also just says NVDA. Well, okay then.

Hey everyone. Let's talk about a request we got to look into NVDA. That's Nvidia. You have probably seen the name in the news a lot lately because their stock is everywhere. They make chips—not the potato kind, but the ones that run computers. For a long time, they were just the guys making graphics cards so your kids could play games without the screen lagging. But now? They are basically the brains behind the whole AI explosion. Here is a quick one for you: back in 1997, they were about six weeks away from going totally broke. Now, they are one of the most valuable companies on the planet. It is a pretty wild comeback story. Anyway, if you are looking at your phone or using a smart gadget today, there is a good chance Nvidia helped make it happen. Alright, let's get back to the music.
