Alright, let's see what we have here. This one is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says: 'Can you read this' followed by a link to 'a website to destroy all websites.' That is the whole thing. Just a link. Sounds a bit intense, but okay, I'll bite. Hey everyone, thanks for tuning in. I just went through that article a listener sent over by a guy named Henry, titled 'A Website To End All Websites.' It's a pretty blunt look at how the internet has changed over the years. Basically, Henry says the web used to feel like this massive, open landscape for learning and actually connecting with people. He argues we've moved away from that into what he calls a 'content farm' era, where we're mostly just scrolling through low-quality junk and fighting off ads. He's not just being nostalgic for the sake of it; his point is that 'Big Tech' has turned our natural desire to connect into a machine that just generates value for shareholders. He then brings up a comparison with cars. He explains how cars started as a tool for freedom, but eventually, the world changed so much that owning a car became a mandatory burden rather than a choice. He uses some ideas from a philosopher named Ivan Illich to show how the tools we build can eventually end up dominating the people they were supposed to serve. He wraps that thought up by pointing out how this same pattern—where things get so big they become a problem—has happened with everything from the clothes we buy to how we use antibiotics. It's a lot to chew on. Should I go ahead and summarize the next part where he talks about his vision for a better version of the web?
