Alright, next one in the inbox is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says 'ndonica suh'. And, well, that is the whole email. There is nothing in the body, just 'ndonica suh'. Short and sweet, I guess.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
