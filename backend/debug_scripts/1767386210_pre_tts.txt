Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com with the subject 'test one two three'. The body of the email is actually empty, so it literally just says 'test one two three'. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
