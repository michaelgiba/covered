Alright, let's see. We've got another one here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'yet again we meet.' But then I open it up and... nothing. The body is just blank. So, that's that. Not really sure what to make of it, but thanks for sending it in anyway. Always good to hear from you guys.
