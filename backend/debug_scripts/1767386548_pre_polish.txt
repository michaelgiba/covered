Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says 'test 123' and the body of the email is... well, it's actually empty. Nothing there at all. Just a blank screen.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
