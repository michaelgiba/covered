Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one comes from Michael Giba. The subject is, 'Difference between next and react native?' and the message is just that: 'Difference between next and react native?' Short and sweet, I like it. So, Michael, here is the deal. Next dot J S is for building websites you open in a browser. React Native is for making mobile apps you download from an app store. One is for the web, the other is for your phone. That is pretty much it. Hope that helps!
