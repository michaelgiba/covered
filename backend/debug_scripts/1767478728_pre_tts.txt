Alright, next one is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line just says: 'who is the U.S. president?' That's it, that's the whole message. I like it—short and to the point. Well, thanks for the email! To answer your question: Joe Biden is the current U.S. president. Hope that clears things up for you!
