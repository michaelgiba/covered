Alright, let's check the inbox. We've got an email here from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line is: 'What is this' with a link to github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm. And the body of the email is just that same question: 'What is this' and the link. Let me pull this up and see what we're looking at.

Hey everyone. I've got a listener recommendation today for a project on GitHub called DiffRhythm. Let me read through the page for you.

The name combines "Diff" (referencing its diffusion architecture) with "Rhythm" (highlighting its focus on music and song creation). The Chinese name 谛韵 (Dì Yùn) phonetically mirrors "DiffRhythm", where "谛" (attentive listening) symbolizes auditory perception, and "韵" (melodic charm) represents musicality. News and Updates 📌 Join Us on Discord! 2025.5.9 🔥 DiffRhythm-v1.2 Official Launch! Version 1.2 largely resolves repetition and omission issues, significantly improves audio quality and arrangement with richer instrumentation, and enables song editing and continuation with advanced understanding of music structure and style. 2025.3.15 🔥 DiffRhythm-full Official Release: Complete Music Generation! The wait is over - 285s full-length music generation is now live! The symphony evolves. What impossible music will you compose next? 2025.3.11 💻 DiffRhythm can now run on MacOS! 2025.3.9 🔥 DiffRhythm Update: Text-to-Music and Pure Music Generation! We're excited to announce two groundbreaking features now live in our open-source music model: 🎯 Text-Based Style Prompts Describe styles/scenes in words (e.g., Jazzy Nightclub Vibe , Pop Emotional Piano or Indie folk ballad, coming-of-age themes, acoustic guitar picking with harmonica interludes ) — no audio reference needed! 🎧 Instrumental Mode Generate pure music with wild prompts like: " Arctic research station, theremin auroras dancing with geomagnetic storms " ✨ Special Thanks to community contributor @Jourdelune for implementing these features via #PR29! Full Release Notes : See src/update_alert.md for details, demos, and roadmap. Break the rules. Make music that shouldn't exist. 2025.3.7 🔥 DiffRhythm is now officially licensed under the Apache 2.0 License ! 🎉 As the first diffusion-based music generation model, DiffRhythm opens up exciting new possibilities for AI-driven creativity in music. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or music enthusiast, we invite you to explore, innovate, and build upon this foundation. 2025.3.6 🔥 The local deployment guide is now available. 2025.3.4 🔥 We released the DiffRhythm paper and Huggingface Space demo . TODOs Support Colab. Gradio support. Dynamic length control Vocals only Song extension Support Docker. Release DiffRhythm-full. Release training code. Support local deployment. Release paper to Arxiv. Online serving on Hugging Face Space. Model Versions Model HuggingFace DiffRhythm-v1.2-base (1m35s) https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-1_2 DiffRhythm-v1.2-full (4m45s) https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-1_2-full DiffRhythm-base (1m35s) https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-base DiffRhythm-full (4m45s) https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-full DiffRhythm-vae https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-vae Docker installation You just need the 3 files inside the folder docker. Do as it follows: Clone the project or copy the files cd into the folder Edit your docker compose biding folders docker compose up -d (or docker-compose up -d depending on your version) docker exec -it DiffRhythm bash You will be in the terminal ready for use. Just go to /home/app/scripts and run infer_prompt_ref.sh Inference Following the steps below to clone the repository and install the environment. # clone and enter the repositry git clone https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm.git cd DiffRhythm # install the environment # # espeak-ng # For Debian-like distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) sudo apt-get install espeak-ng # For RedHat-like distribution (e.g. CentOS, Fedora, etc.) sudo yum install espeak-ng # For MacOS brew install espeak-ng # For Windows # Please visit https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases to download .msi installer # # create python environment conda create -n diffrhythm python=3.10 conda activate diffrhythm # # OR you can use classic Python virtual enviroment instead of conda python -m venv venv # activate venv on Linux source venv/bin/activate # activate venv on Windows venv \\Scripts\\activate # # install requirements pip install -r requirements.txt On Linux you can now simply use the inference script: # For inference using a reference WAV file bash scripts/infer_wav_ref.sh # For inference using a text prompt reference bash scripts/infer_prompt_ref.sh But before running the inference on Windows, make sure you set the user enviroment variables: PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY -> C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG\\libespeak-ng.dll PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_PATH -> C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG Change C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG to your eSpeak installation directory and reboot your PC to apply changes. Installing Japanese voices, mbrola binaries and unpacking an mbrola_ph folder (as described here and here ) are no longer required when running on Windows. See #17 (comment) , this and this commit . After this, you will also be able to run inference scripts on Windows (please note that English lyrics will be used here): rem : For inference using a reference WAV file call scripts\\infer_wav_ref.bat rem : For inference using a text prompt reference call scripts\\infer_prompt_ref.bat Example files of lrc and reference audio can be found in infer/example . You can use the tools we provide on huggingface to generate the lrc. Note that DiffRhythm-base requires a minimum of 8G of VRAM. To meet the 8G VRAM requirement, use the --chunked argument when running the inference. Higher VRAM may be required if chunked decoding is disabled. Training Coming soon... License & Disclaimer DiffRhythm (code and DiT weights) is released under the Apache License 2.0 . This open-source license allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the model, as long as you include the appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer. We do not make any profit from this model. Our goal is to provide a high-quality base model for music generation, fostering innovation in AI music and contributing to the advancement of h. And that's it. Pretty deep dive into some cool audio tech. See you next time.
