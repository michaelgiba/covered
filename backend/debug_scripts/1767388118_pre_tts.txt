Okay, let's see... we've got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line just says 'test one two three' and, well, there's actually nothing in the body. It's completely blank. Just a quick check-in, I guess? I'm not really sure what to make of that one, but hey, thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
