Alright, next one in the inbox is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject says NVDA and the message is just NVDA. Keeping it simple, I see.

Alright, let's talk about a listener suggestion: NVDA. Most of you know them as Nvidia. They're the folks making those fancy chips that everyone is obsessed with right now. It used to be just for kids playing high-end video games, but now, every tech giant is basically throwing money at them to power AI. If you've wondered why the stock market is acting crazy, these guys are usually in the middle of it. Fun fact for you: the name comes from the Latin word 'invidia,' which means envy. Their logo is green because they wanted their rivals to be green with envy. Pretty confident, right? Anyway, that's the quick scoop on the tech giant. Back to the music.
