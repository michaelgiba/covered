Hey there. Got another one here to look at from the inbox. This one is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com and the subject line says, 'yet again we meet.' There’s actually nothing in the body of the email, just that subject. Short and sweet, I guess. Not exactly sure what to make of it, but thanks for sending it in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
