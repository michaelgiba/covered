Alright, moving on to the inbox. We’ve got an email here from Michael Giba. He asks: Difference between Next and React Native? Short and sweet, Michael. I like it. So, here is the deal: Next dot J S is for building websites that run in a browser. It is great for speed and actually showing up in Google searches. React Native, on the other hand, is for building mobile apps that people download on their phones, like for an iPhone or Android. They both use React, but one stays on the web and the other goes in your pocket. Simple as that. Hope that clears it up for you!
