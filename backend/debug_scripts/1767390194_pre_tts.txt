Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one's from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. Subject says 'testing one two three' and... well, the body's actually empty. Just a quick test message, I guess. Not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway! Always good to hear from you guys.
