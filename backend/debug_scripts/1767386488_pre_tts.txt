Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is 'testing one two three' and the body is just 'testing one two three.' Keeping it short, I guess. Not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
