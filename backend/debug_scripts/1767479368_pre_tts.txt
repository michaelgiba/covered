Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is 'ndonica suh,' and honestly, that's the whole message. There's nothing else in the body. Just 'ndonica suh.' I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
