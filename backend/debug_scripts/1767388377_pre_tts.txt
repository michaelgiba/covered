Hey folks. We just got an email over at covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says, 'testing the backglo', and that's actually the whole thing—there's nothing in the body of the message. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
