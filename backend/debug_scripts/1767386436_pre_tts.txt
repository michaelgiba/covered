Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is 'testing the backglo' and the message... well, it just says 'testing the backglo.' Keeping it simple, I guess. Not quite sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in. Always good to hear from you guys.
