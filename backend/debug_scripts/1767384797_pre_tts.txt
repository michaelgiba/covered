Alright, next one. We've got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject just says 'testing one two three' and the body... well, it's actually empty. There's nothing else there, just a blank screen. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway! It's always good to hear from you guys.
