Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one comes from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is 'yet again we meet' and the message itself says exactly that: 'yet again we meet.' Straight to the point, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of it, but thanks for writing in anyway. It is always good to hear from you guys.
