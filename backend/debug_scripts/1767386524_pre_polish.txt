Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line is 'ndonica suh,' and the body of the email says the exact same thing: 'ndonica suh.' Keeping it simple, I guess.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
