Alright, let's see what we've got here. This next one is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject is 'ndonica suh' and... well, that's actually the whole thing. There's nothing in the body of the email. So, it just says 'ndonica suh'.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
