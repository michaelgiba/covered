Alright, got an email here from Michael Giba. Michael kept it short and sweet—the subject line is, Difference between next and react native?, and the body is just... the exact same question again. Fair enough. So, Michael, here is the simple version: Next dot J S is for building websites that you open in a browser. React Native is for building apps you actually install on your phone. They both use React, so they feel pretty similar, but they just build different things. Hope that helps!
