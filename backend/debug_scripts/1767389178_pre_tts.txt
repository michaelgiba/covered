Alright, next one up is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'ndonica suh' and... well, that’s actually the whole email. Nothing in the body at all. Just 'ndonica suh.' I'm not really sure what to make of that one, but hey, thanks for reaching out anyway. Always good to hear from you guys.
