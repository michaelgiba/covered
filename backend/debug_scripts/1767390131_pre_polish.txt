Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says 'testing the backglo'. As for the body of the email... well, there's nothing actually in there. It's just 'testing the backglo'.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
