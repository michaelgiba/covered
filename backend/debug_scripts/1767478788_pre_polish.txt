Alright, next one in the pile is from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line says 'testing the backglo'. As for the body of the email... well, there's nothing actually there. Just a blank message. Simple enough.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
