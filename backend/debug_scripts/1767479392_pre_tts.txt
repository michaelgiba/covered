Alright, let's see here. We've got an email from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is 'test one two three' and the body... well, there's actually nothing there. Just a test. Keeping it simple, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
