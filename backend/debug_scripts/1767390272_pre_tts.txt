Alright, let's see what's in the inbox. We've got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is test one two three and the body is... well, it's actually blank. There's nothing else there. Just a test, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
