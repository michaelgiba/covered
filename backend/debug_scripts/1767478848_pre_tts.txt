Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'testing one two three' and the body of the email... well, it just says 'testing one two three' too. Not much to work with there, but there it is. I'm not exactly sure what to do with that one, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
