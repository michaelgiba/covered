Alright, moving on to the next one. This email is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com and the subject line says, 'yet again we meet.' And... that's actually it. Nothing in the body at all. Straight to the point, I guess? Not really sure what to make of that, but thanks for sending it in regardless. It's always good to hear from you guys.
