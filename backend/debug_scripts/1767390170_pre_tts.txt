So, I’ve got an email here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says, 'yet again we meet,' but that’s the whole thing—there’s actually nothing in the body of the message. Just those four words. Short and sweet, I guess. Not really sure what to do with that, but hey, thanks for reaching out anyway. It’s always good to hear from you guys.
