Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox here. This one comes from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line is 'ndonica suh' and the message itself just says... 'ndonica suh.' That is it. That's the whole thing. I'm not really sure what to make of that one, but thanks for writing in anyway. It is always good to hear from you guys.
