Hey everyone. I just got an email from Michael Giba with a forward from The Washington Post dated January fourth, twenty twenty-six. The subject is, "The Post Most: Rubio takes on most challenging role yet." The main headline says: "Rubio takes on most challenging role yet: Viceroy of Venezuela." It says the top U. S. diplomat has pushed for regime change for over a decade, and now the hard part begins. There are some live updates too, like, "Maduro held in New York as quiet unease falls over Venezuela," and a look back at what we learned about microplastics in twenty twenty-five. There is a story on how the National Zoo feeds its animals, and an opinion piece by George Will called, "Trump goes monster-hunting, untainted by a whiff of legality." Other headlines include, "The big obstacles to Trump's plan for a Venezuelan oil windfall," and, "Secret Service plans unprecedented staff surge." They even have one about food: "Bologna in the carbonara? Call Italy's pasta police!" It ends with some New Year's resolution tips and N F L news about the Seahawks getting the top seed. Sounds like a lot is going on. I tried to check out the link for more info, but I couldn't access it.
