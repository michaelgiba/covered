Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one is from michael giba at gmail dot com. Michael asks: 'Difference between next and react native?' Short and to the point. I like that. Well Michael, it's actually pretty simple. Next dot J S is for building websites that you open in a browser. React Native is for making apps you actually install on your phone. Since they both use React, once you know one, you're basically halfway there. One's for the web, the other's for the App Store. Hope that helps!
