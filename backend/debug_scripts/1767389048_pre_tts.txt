Alright, I've got an email here from Michael Giba. He's keeping it short and sweet. He asks: 'Difference between next and react native?' That's the whole thing. I like it. To the point. So, Michael, to keep it simple: Next dot J S is for building websites that run in a browser. React Native is for building mobile apps that you actually download on your phone. They both use React, but they're just for totally different screens. Hope that helps!
