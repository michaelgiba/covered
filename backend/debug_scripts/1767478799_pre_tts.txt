Alright, next one in the pile is from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. Subject line says, 'testing the backglo' and for the body... well, there's actually nothing there. Just a blank message. Simple enough. Not really sure what to make of it, but hey, thanks for writing in. Always good to hear from you guys.
