Alright, let's see what we've got in the inbox. This one's from covered app inbox at gmail dot com, and the subject line says, 'testing the backglo'. Looking at the body of the email... well, there's actually nothing there. It just says 'testing the backglo' again. I'm not really sure what to make of that, but hey, thanks for writing in. It's always good to hear from you guys.
