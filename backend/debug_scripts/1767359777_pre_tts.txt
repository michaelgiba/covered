Alright, let's check the inbox. We've got one here from coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject is 'Another one' and the message simply asks: 'what's the best sopranos episode?' Man, that's a tough choice, but for me, it's gotta be 'Pine Barrens.' Watching Paulie and Christopher lose their minds out in the woods is just classic. If you're looking for something a bit more intense though, 'Whitecaps' is a solid runner-up. Enjoy the rewatch!
