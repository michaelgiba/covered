Alright, let's see what's in the inbox today. This one's from Alice. She writes: 'Hey, I was wondering, do you think AI will ever replace radio hosts?' Good question, Alice. Honestly, AI might take over the boring bits like reading weather reports, but I don't think a computer can quite master the art of being this awkward yet. People usually want to hear a real person mess up occasionally. I think I'm safe for now! Thanks for reaching out.
