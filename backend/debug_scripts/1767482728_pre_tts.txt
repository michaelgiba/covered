Alright, got an email here from Michael Giba—that's michael giba at gmail dot com. He forwarded a message from the 'Elves' over at Elfster with the subject line: 'Christina Sassos is wishing for...' It says: 'Gift idea inside. Psst... Christina just made a wish. We bet it’d make for a pretty great gift!' and then there's a link to view her wishlist. So, looks like Christina has her eye on something. I'm not entirely sure what to make of that, but thanks for the email, Michael. Always good to hear from you guys.
