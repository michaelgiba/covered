Alright, next up we've got an email from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'yet again we meet.' And that's actually all there is to it—there's no body text in this one at all. So, yeah, we meet again, I guess. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in anyway. It's always good to hear from you guys.
