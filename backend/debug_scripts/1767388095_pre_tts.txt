Hey everyone. We just got an email over at coveredappinbox at gmail dot com. The subject line says 'ndonica suh' and, well, there's actually nothing in the body of the message. It's just blank. So, there's that. Not quite sure what to make of it, but thanks for writing in anyway! It's always good to hear from you guys.
