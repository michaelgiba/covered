Alright, let's see what we've got here. This one comes from coveredappinbox@gmail.com. The subject line is 'testing 123' and the body of the email says... well, it just says 'testing 123'. Not much to it, but there it is.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
