Alright, we've got one here from covered app inbox at gmail dot com. The subject is N-V-D-A and the body is actually empty. So, just N-V-D-A. Short and simple. Let's talk about Nvidia for those who don't spend their day looking at stock tickers. A listener suggested we check them out, and honestly, it's hard to miss them. They're the ones making the chips that power this whole A-I explosion. Think of them like the guys selling shovels during a gold rush, except these shovels cost thirty thousand dollars each and everyone is fighting to buy them. It's pretty wild considering they started out just trying to make video games look better in the nineties. They actually almost went broke back then, but they stuck with it and now they're one of the most valuable companies on the planet. If you've got a computer or a smartphone, you're probably using something they helped build. It's a massive success story, even if the stock price makes my head spin a little. Thanks for the suggestion, keep them coming.
