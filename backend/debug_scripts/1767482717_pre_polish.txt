Alright, folks, I've got an email here from Michael Giba—that's michaelgiba@gmail.com. He forwarded a message from the 'Elves' at Elfster with the subject line: 'Christina Sassos is wishing for...' It says: 'Gift idea inside. Psst... Christina just made a wish. We bet it’d make for a pretty great gift!' and then it provides a link to view Christina’s wishlist. Looks like someone has their eye on something special.

I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but thanks for writing in! Always good to hear from you guys.
