Alright, let's check the inbox. We've got an email from michael giba at gmail dot com. The subject line is "Testing cross platofmr"—looks like a typo there—and the body simply asks: "how do you do it?" Short and sweet, Michael. I like it. To answer your question, testing across different platforms usually comes down to using tools like Appium or Selenium so you can run the same tests on both iOS and Android. And look, if you don't want to go out and buy twenty different phones, most people just use a service like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to test on devices in the cloud. It's not the most exciting work in the world, but it gets the job done.
