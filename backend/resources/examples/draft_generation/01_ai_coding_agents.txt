Now i'm seeing a message from alice@example.com. 
She asks 'Do you think AI will replace junior devs soon? I'm worried about my job prospects.'

Look, Alice, I get the anxiety, I really do. 
It's crazy out there right now, I swear every other week it seems like AI is going to 
take my job more and more. Like, things I didn't think would ever be possible last week
and easily done in minutes by some supercomputer now.

But here is the thing, at the moment at a least, AI is evenly distributed. By that I mean
others are out there asking the same question. It's all about using it to your advantage 
and learning to accomplish what you what to accomplish with the new tool available to you.
